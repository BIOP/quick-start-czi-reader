# Quick start Bio-Formats CZI reader

A revamped version of the original ZeissCZIReader which parses faster the metadata. This is critical to open multi-TB files in Fiji in a reasonable amount of time.

For more information see:
- the [original issue](https://github.com/ome/bioformats/issues/3839)
- a [draft PR on Bio-Formats](https://github.com/ome/bioformats/pull/4009)

To use this reader instead of the original one, you will need to activate a Fiji update site, (not implemented yet)

Special thanks to Zeiss for [opening its file format](https://github.com/ZEISS/libczi) and allowing open source software to improve!
